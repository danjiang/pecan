## BMI

### What is BMI?

The body mass index (BMI), is a measure of relative weight based on an individual's mass and height.

### Calculate BMI

> BMI = Mass / (Height × Height)

unit of weight: kg (kilogram), unit of height: m (meter)

### BMI Level

* Thin : BMI < 18.5
* Health : 18.5 <= BMI < 23.9
* Overweight : 23.9 <= BMI < 27.9
* Fat : 27.9 <= BMI

## BFR

### What is BFR?

The body fat rate of a human or other living being is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass. It is a measure of fitness level.

### Calculate BFR

> BFR = [ 1.2 × BMI + 0.23 × Age - 5.4 - 10.8 × Gender ( Male = 1，Female = 0 ) ] × 100%
